A test repository for getting used to how GitHub works


What is Git? What is GitHub?
============================

Git is a system that allows collaboration on programming projects. It is used in the creation/updating of Linux.
GitHub makes Git more friendly (ie, you won't need to use the command line).
The basic idea is that anyone can copy all the files in the project, make a change or two, and then request to have the changes implemented.
Normally, people would send requests for changes to just 1 author, but with this setup, everyone is an author (everyone can make changes without approval).
Look at the [USINGGITHUB.md] [3] file for more info on terms.


Signing Up
==========

Format your account name as “FirstnameLastname” (without quotes) to prevent confusion.
Send a link to your account to alex.lamson@gmail.com and I'll add you to the group.
A profile picture is not necessary, but would be helpful.

Note: Everyone will be an owner of this group. That means everyone is an admin. Please be careful not to accidentally change billing to $100/month or something like that.


Setting Up Git
==============

* If you plan to work on programs at home (that means either having an NXT and some parts to test with, or being able to program without them) [download the GitHub application] [1] (press the big green/orange button at the top)
* If you are only going to program during the work sessions (which is more likely) and won't be bringing your computer to each session, don't bother downloading the application. It will be much easier to use the website to upload individual files directly. They call it [GitHub Flow] [2].
