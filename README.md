TeachingRepo
============

A test repository to learn how github works

What is Git? What is Github?
============================

Git is a system that allow collaboration on programming projects. It was/is used in the creation of linux.
Github is a way to use git in a much friendly way (ie, you won’t need to use the command line every time to want to make a change).
The basic idea is that anyone can copy all the files in the project, make a change or two, and then request to have the changes implemented.
Normally, there would be 1 author for a repository, and people send requests for changes, but with this setup, everyone should be able to make changes without approval.
Look at the USINGGITHUB.md file for more info on terms.

Setting Up Git
==============

* If you plan to work on programs at home (that means either having an nxt and some parts to test with, or being able to program without them): https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git (press the big green/orange button at the top)
* If you are only going to do programming at school (during the work sessions), don't bother downloading the application. It will be much easier to use the website to upload individual files directly.
