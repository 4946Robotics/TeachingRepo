Repository
==========
As repository (usually abbreviated to repo) basically is a project contianing a bunch of source files.


Commit
======
A change to the repository. After you are done making changes, you submit your changes with a brief description of what was add, removed and modified.


Branch
======
Instead of using a linear system of versioning, git uses "branches".
Each branch is a copy of the repo, with some changes.
The advantage is that its much easier to isolate specific changes, and test many changes simultaneously.


Pull Request
============
A proposed set of changes.

Push
====
When a set of changes gets applied to the actual branch.
