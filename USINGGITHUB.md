Repository
==========
A repository (usually abbreviated to repo) is a project containing a bunch of source files.


Branch
======
Instead of using a linear versioning system, Git uses "branches".
Branches let you test ideas without bringing them into the offical program. They also let you introduce ideas into the offical program (when the changes are ready) quite easily.
The offical branch is called the master branch.


Commit
======
A submission of changes to make in the branch. Generally also contains brief summary of what was added, removed or modified.
Note: don't title a commit "Update" or "Changed some stuff" - that doesn't explain anything. Try to include descriptive titles to your commits.
Its better to make a lot of small commits than only a few large commits because that makes it easier to revert to a previous version more precisely (losing a minimum amount of work).


Pull Request
============
A proposed set of changes sent to the author. (You don't really need to worry about this)


Push
====
When a set of changes gets applied to the branch. Everyone will download the new version over their old copies when this happens (if they are=n't editing the same thing themselves).
