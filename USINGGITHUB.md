Repository
==========
A repository (usually abbreviated to repo) is basically a project containing a bunch of source files.


Branch
======
Instead of using a linear system of versioning, Git uses "branches".
Branches let you test ideas without bringing them into the offical program. They also let you introduce them into the offical program (when the changes are ready) quite easily.
The offical branch is called the master branch.

Commit
======
A submission of changes to make in the branch. Generally also contains brief summary of what was added, removed or modified.


Pull Request
============
A proposed set of changes sent to the author.


Push
====
When a set of changes gets applied to the branch. Everyone will download the new version over their old copies when this happens.
