Every time you start making changes:

* To open the folder where the files are located, click "tools", the "open in explorer"

Every time you make a change:
* Make changes whatever changes you want
* When you're done, go back to the github application
* In the top right it will say "uncommited changes" - click the "show" button
* Summarize the changes that you will be making in the COMMIT MESSAGE field (look at the history for a general * idea of what it might look like)
* If the letters turn gray at the end of the message, its too long - shorten it and include more info in the * extended description
